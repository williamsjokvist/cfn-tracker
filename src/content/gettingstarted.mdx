import DownloadButton from '../components/DownloadButton.astro'

# Getting Started
- Download the app for either Mac or Windows
  <DownloadButton transition:persist/>

- Extract the app wherever you want and launch it.
- Select either SF6 or Tekken 8.
- Input your user ID when prompted and press *Start*.
- Tracking has now started. Go to the Output screen, pick a theme and mark the stats you want to display.
- Click *Copy Browser Source Link*.
- Open OBS and add a Browser Source, paste the link as the source.

Text files will also be generated in a folder called *results* (in the same directory as the app). It's more memory efficient to import these into text labels in OBS instead of creating a browser source.
